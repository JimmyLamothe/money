Idea for a game - simulation (colab with Nicki Case?)

Human (or alien? humanoid) body, but every cell functions according to
ecnomic rules - change the base assumptions and see how the body
functions - what happens if cells only work if they are paid? What
happens if cells can accumulate more ressources than they need? -
Cells need minimum ressources or they die - How does body function or
not? Different cell categories - builders is the easy one, what are
the others? Each cell category maps to a societal equivalent or not?
Cell happiness level

Ideally this should be able to mirror different conceptions of
capitalism in a way that works, but only if you find the right
assumptions - shows what assumptions each economic model needs to make
to be true
