Title: Stop paying the ego tax

Lede: I'd like to start by apologizing for writing a self-help book that won't help you directly. Learning not to overfeed your ego is no doubt the hardest thing to do. It's the work of more than one lifetime, and I mean that quite literally, as I'll explain later. When you first read this book, you'll quite likely even take a backwards step in that pursuit, as the natural tendency is to task your ego with fighting your ego, which can only end in failure.

But I hope that as you go on about your life, read other books, watch movies, talk with strangers and loved ones, you find yourself evolving naturally, but very slowly, towards a less ego-driven life, helped in some small manner by perspectives you'll come across here.

NOTES: More than one lifetime = many generations - we don't all start from the same point / Ego tax = the cost in each interaction of having to assuage your ego, or the other person's ego. This is probably the only tax you are allowed not to pay.

NOTES: Be aware of your ego. The tax is always lower if you know you're paying it than if you think you're not.

NOTES: Meeting example when explaining what the ego tax is. Meeting takes longer because people need to show they are important
